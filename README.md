This is my second attempt at making a space program management game. The first was abandoned quite early because of the ridiculous amount of effort to draw everything in the right order and to render user made rockets. So I thought: what if I didn't need to do this? So I decided to try and retry using TKinter, which I hope will make the game much easier to make, and will give it the aesthetics of Universal Paperclips (a really good game, you should try it, it's free in your browser). Maybe in the distant future I could make it multiplayer.
